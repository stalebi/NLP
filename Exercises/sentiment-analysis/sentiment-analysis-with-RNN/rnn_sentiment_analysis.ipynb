We now switch gears and use Recurrent Neural Networks, and in particular LSTMs, to perform sentiment analysis in Keras. Conveniently, Keras has a built-in [IMDb movie reviews dataset](https://keras.io/datasets/#imdb-movie-reviews-sentiment-classification) that we can use, with the same vocabulary size."

    "- The first thing is to try and improve the accuracy of your model by experimenting with different architectures, layers and parameters. How good can you get without taking prohibitively long to train? How do you prevent overfitting?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Then, you may want to deploy your model as a mobile app or web service. What do you need to do in order to package your model for such deployment? How would you accept a new review, convert it into a form suitable for your model, and perform the actual prediction? (Note that the same environment you used during training may not be available.)\n",
    "\n",
    "- One simplification we made in this notebook is to limit the task to binary classification. The dataset actually includes a more fine-grained review rating that is indicated in each review's filename (which is of the form `<[id]_[rating].txt>` where `[id]` is a unique identifier and `[rating]` is on a scale of 1-10; note that neutral reviews > 4 or < 7 have been excluded). How would you modify the notebook to perform regression on the review ratings? In what situations is regression more useful than classification, and vice-versa?\n",

    "Whatever direction you take, make sure to share your results and learnings with your peers, through blogs, discussions and participating in online competitions. This is also a great way to become more visible to potential employers!"
